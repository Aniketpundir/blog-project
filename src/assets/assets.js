    Article: `The word "men" has a lot of connotations, whether they relate to family, society, or money. This man is constantly held accountable for duties that were never clearly assigned to him. A man who is unemployed and free is frequently referred to as useless. Simply because he is unable to spend enough time with his family, a hard-working man is labelled selfish. They are frequently held accountable for everything they do since they have already received superiority in the society, which they did not request.
Sons, brothers, husbands, fathers, grandparents, and so on are frequently the pillars of society. However, they also hold the unique title of warriors. Several men have made equal or greater contributions in the past, but they are still not even acknowledged today. This article highlights a few lesser-known Indian-born men whose goal was to improve society in various ways. 

The first is Havildar Ishar Singh (1858–1897), a highly regarded Indian Sikh war hero who fought in the Tirah Campaign on the North-West Frontier. At the age of 18, he joined the Punjab Frontier Force, and in 1887, he moved to the 36th Sikhs. In modern-day Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Saragarhi is a tiny signal post situated between Fort Lockhart and Fort Gulistan. Singh commanded 21 Sikh soldiers in the Saragarhi War against between 10,000 and 12,000 Pashtun tribesmen. Without food, water, or reinforcements, they resisted for about six to eight hours. They continuously called for assistance, but there were no signals. Before every defender was overrun, they killed hundreds of attackers, with each Sikh reportedly taking out about 20 enemy soldiers. The last survivor, Sepoy Gurmukh Singh, broadcast the battle via heliograph while shouting, "Bole So Nihaal… Sat Sri Akaal!" until he died. Celebrated as one of the greatest last stands in history, Saragarhi Day is observed on September 12 every year to honour the bravery and courage of the 21 Sikhs.

Dara Shikoh comes next. He was born in Ajmer in 1615 to Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan. He was known as Shah e Buland Iqbal and was crowned crown prince in 1642. He was also known as Pad Shahzada i Buzurg Martaba at a young age. Sufism had a strong influence on Dara Shikoh, who welcomed mysticism and spiritual diversity. He wrote comparative works like Majma ul Bahrain, which explored the harmonies between Sufi and Vedantic thought, and commissioned Persian translations of the Bhagavad Gita and the Upanishads (52 texts). Dara promoted calligraphy, painting, music, and fine arts in addition to spirituality; his own album was included in royal collections. Among the architectural projects he commissioned were the Pari Mahal garden-library palace in Srinagar (c. 1650) and the Akhund Mullah Shah Mosque in Srinagar (1649). Dara contested for the throne after Shah Jahan became ill in 1657, but his brother Aurangzeb defeated him and had him put to death in 1659. In contemporary India, Dara is still revered as a representation of intellectual curiosity, tolerance, and interfaith harmony. He envisioned what a more pluralistic Mughal Empire might have been and is regarded as a sharp contrast to Aurangzeb's traditional rule. His difference with Aurangzeb is analysed by numerous historians; some regard Dara as lacking in political savvy, while others honour his cultural heritage. 

Yuyutsu, a prominent but frequently disregarded figure in the Mahabharata, is the next legend. He was the Kauravas' half-brother, the son of Dhritarashtra and a Vaishya (maid) woman. Yuyutsu chose dharma over blood loyalty, even though he was born into the Kauravas family. He showed great moral courage by defecting from the Kauravas and joining the Pandavas on the eve of the great Kurukshetra war. He bravely fought the entire battle as one of the eleven Maharathis on the Pandavas' side. The fact that Yuyutsu was one of the few warriors to survive the war and was later given a significant role in Hastinapura's governance speaks volumes about his moral character and sense of justice. Even in the face of interpersonal strife and familial ties, his story serves as an example of righteousness.

The final legend is that of Guru Arjan Dev Ji (1563–1606), the fifth Guru of Sikhism and a key figure in the institutional and spiritual development of the religion. He was Guru Ram das Ji's youngest son and was born in Goindval, Punjab. He put together the Adi Granth, the Sikhs' first sacred text, which subsequently evolved into the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikhism's everlasting Guru. In addition, Guru Arjan Ji built Amritsar's Harmandir Sahib (Golden Temple), which became a major site of worship open to followers of all religions and castes.

During his tenure, the Sikh community gained social and political prominence, attracting the Mughal Empire's attention. The first Sikh martyr was Guru Arjan Dev Ji, who was detained and tortured to death in 1606 on Emperor Jahangir's orders. He exemplified the spirit of nonviolent resistance and unwavering faith by accepting death with composure and refusing to convert to Islam. His martyrdom marked a sea change in Sikh history, and subsequent Gurus encouraged the community to take a more combative posture. The legacy of Guru Arjan Dev Ji is one of sacrifice, social equality, and spiritual wisdom.

    Article: `Have we ever attempted to take a closer look at our history in the modern world where people are more interested in learning about the lives of Bollywood actors and creating the right aesthetics for Instagram stories? Both history and the stories it contains are vast. There is much to learn, but we don't prioritise it.
Legends from all over the world have made important contributions to their countries and altered our understanding of the past. It has also influenced the current state of the world.
History has always taught us something, even if we aren't aware of it. For instance, the ancient Ayurvedic texts already discuss how to treat cancer, a condition that hasn't been fully understood yet. Somewhere in those texts that are not widely known are the new technologies that are being developed all over the world.
Therefore, it is imperative that we look back into the past and learn about a variety of topics that will be very beneficial in the future.
Even so, there are legends in every industry, whether it be social acts, technological advancements, etc. It's always a few outliers who help people escape a big problem.
This article discusses a few lesser-known Indian-born women whose mission was to create a better version of the society in different ways.
The first legend is Savitribai Phule, who championed women's rights and was India's first female teacher. She was born in Naigaon, Maharashtra, on January 3, 1831. She had to deal with numerous disadvantages from an early age, such as being a girl who was only exposed to the kitchen and values, coming from the backward Mali caste, etc. Like all the other girls of that era, she was married to Jyoti Rao Phule, a social reformer, when she was nine years old. This greatly helped her, and she started to read and write with her husband's help. The couple supported one another because they had similar ideas and opinions. After she received teaching training and became the first female teacher in India, they soon established a school for girls in Pune in 1848. She helped students from lower castes and Dalits, particularly girls who were underprivileged in both areas. However, as she began to grow in the middle of the 1800s, she encountered a great deal of criticism because people at the time did not believe that a woman could make history. She developed in many ways, including publishing her poetry and opposing customs that favoured girls and members of lower castes, such as child marriage and untouchability. Because some people would throw trash, faeces, etc. on her in the middle, she was so brave that she would bring an extra piece of saree to her teaching institution. Because of her significant contributions, Maharashtra celebrates Balikan Diwas on her birthday each year.

Next up is Dr. Anandibai Joshi, a remarkable woman who was among the first female doctors in India. 
Similar to Savitribai Phule, who was discussed above, she was married at the young age of nine to a man who was twenty. However, after a terrible accident in which they were unable to save their child, her husband, who was supportive, persuaded her to finish her education. She attended Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania at the age of 19, and she has consistently advocated for more women physicians in India.
After graduating, she also got a note from Queen Victoria thanking her for everything she had done.
Later, she travelled to Kolhapur and began treating patients there. She later passed away at the age of 21 from tuberculosis.
At such a young age, she made a significant contribution to society and was a woman full of dreams and aspirations.

Phoolan Devi is a woman who merits more positive recognition than the animosity she received. She was born on August 10, 1963, in Gorha Ka Purva, Uttar Pradesh, into a family of Mallah (boatmen), who are regarded as a lower caste. She is well-known as the Bandit Queen. She was married at the young age of eleven, just like the tradition that persisted. Her husband, however, wasn't encouraging this time; in fact, he mistreated her psychologically and physically. She ran several times before being apprehended. After being abducted by a dacoit gang in the Chambal Valley, she joined them and was repeatedly sexually assaulted by men from higher castes. Later, those men were put to death in the village of Behmai as retaliation. She spent a solid 11 years in prison because she disobeyed the law. She later entered politics and became well-known. She was assassinated in Delhi on July 25, 2001, by a man who subsequently claimed that it was retaliation for the Behmai massacre.
She was a brave woman who killed several rapists to instil fear in their hearts. She quickly responded, "Definitely not a woman," when asked what she would like to become in her next life. She would be happy to be a dog, a bee, or anything else, but never a woman.

Thus, these were the lesser-known stories of some brave Indian women who worked to alter society's viewpoint and brought about significant change. Though not with the proper eyes, they are still identifiable. Everyone should be aware of what they have contributed to India overall, and they merit greater recognition.

    Article_heading: "FROM WHITE BOARD TO BOARD EXAMS",
    Article: `"Sometimes all it takes is finding a piece of yourself through different events that don't often fall on your calendar. One such instance occurred at the start of grade X, when your parents expect you to pilot the space shuttle, but all you know is the pressure that you must be perfect. It can come as a sudden shock to realize that you've come a long way and that this is the first significant thing you'll ever have to deal with. Suddenly, everyone around me became my competitors, and things turned dull. My parents understood that I needed to be less human and more robotic because this was a crucial time in my life. I was stressed out in the first few days after putting in more than four hours of self-study, three hours of coaching, and a lifetime of education. Even though I knew it was just the final board exams, I used to tell myself, \"Wow this is it, I can't tolerate anymore.\" In any case, I must repeat this so that my parents are proud of me. All I could sense at the moment was the fleeting success. In any case, up until grade IX, I was a student who did everything in my power to finish my own mug. However, at first, it was nice to attend coaching and receive assistance outside of school. I followed my guardians' instructions to the letter, but I still hoped to return even stronger. Everything went really well; my teachers were helpful, and I felt like I could perform a lot better if I consistently put in the same amount of effort in my subjects. Prior to grade X, I had this thing of getting sick or having some sort of mishap during my exams. This time, I asked God to clear my path of such impediments. And it came true. That god simply ignored it because I had a leg injury due to which I wasn't able to attend my school and coaching for a good 15 days. Then came the half-yearly examinations, where I did fairly well, with the exception of mathematics, which left me feel insecure. I used to think I wasn't cut out for technical tasks and subjects that required more internal capacity than memorization. My mother was my strongest advocate and support system. Despite her own fear of mathematics, she was able to help me break free from the constant cycle of fear that made me feel more insecure every day. My father, who didn't create a schedule himself when he was a child, made a schedule that worked for me and fit all of my activities. I experienced the strongest emotional and psychological effects there. They made me believe that even if all the doors are closed, there is still a hope left. When most students are at their lowest, I believe this is what they need. Now that November had arrived, it was time to see how much I could truly score in the board examination. By this point, I was confident that I had done fairly well in both pre-board examinations. To this day, I attribute my recovery from losing myself in the middle of the year to my parents. I nearly looked through YouTube by the middle of February, when the board exams were due, but there was nothing left. Now, a nervous girl who has never in her life scored higher than 90 gave it her all and gave herself a chance. The day finally arrived, and I had to demonstrate my understanding of everything from the previous year. Exams eventually came and went, and every day I gained a little more self-assurance. What I had sown, the results were in, we received the news at school. I was trembling badly as I hurried home from school. I opened my results with shaking hands, and I was shocked to see that I had received a solid 96%. I felt like I had finally accomplished my goal and was on cloud nine. However, in actuality, class X is irrelevant. Your grade in class 10 is useless. It's only meant to give you hope for the more challenging portion of your life that lies ahead. I was devastated to learn that it would not be taken into consideration anywhere. \n\nAfter losing myself for a year, I realized that if I study literature, history, and archaeology, I can truly become a better version of myself. Prior to grade X, I genuinely disliked social science, but I learnt how fascinating history is in grade X. How a reader consumes the content is entirely up to them. That really helped me realize that social science, which I had never been interested in, turned out to be the most fascinating subject I had ever studied, and mathematics, which I was afraid of, actually turned out to be easy and that\'s something that I discovered after losing my original self for a year."

    Article_heading: "OFFERINGS & OVERFLOW",
    Article: `Haridwar, also known as Hari ka Dwar (Gateway to God), is a revered location in Uttarakhand on the banks of the Ganges River. Eight million religious tourists come here each year on average. Haridwar is really about the Ganges, hundreds of temples, and never-ending chanting. People from all over the world come here to perform good deeds and take a dip in the sacred river, which they believe can wash away all of their past karmic debts and release them from any wrongdoings that may have occurred accidentally. One can find stability and serenity in Haridwar. By examining the average number alone, this can be comprehended. Haridwar is a site of great spiritual significance because it is thought to be the location where drops of amrit (nectar of immortality) fell during the celestial battle between gods and demons. As a starting point for the Char Dham Yatra, a revered pilgrimage to the Himalayan shrines of Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath, it is considered one of the seven holiest sites (Sapta Puri) in Hindu tradition. 
However, what is Haridwar now? Trash everywhere. Yes, trash in the rivers, close to temples, etc. Red spits are now all over the painted and god-dedicated walls. Is this the same Haridwar that Lord Vishnu has valued above all others? The degradation of the environment is a growing problem beneath this spiritual vibrancy. Once regarded as a purifier, the Ganges frequently takes the brunt of the devotion it engenders. An urgent question is raised by this paradox: Is it possible for Haridwar and similar locations to reconcile sustainability and religion?
Every year, there are events like the Kumbh Mela and the Kanwar Yatra that attract millions of people. Even though these gatherings are spiritually enlightening, they frequently result in an excessive amount of waste, much of which ends up in the Ganga. This waste includes plastic packaging, food scraps, artificial offerings, and untreated sewage.
Nowadays, blind devotion is being practiced. According to what their spiritual leader has told them, they are leaving bits of holy clothing, fruits, sweets, and other items in the Ganga. They frequently forget what they are doing, which is just another problem for the local wildlife. Will the sadness of those living things please your god? People need to realize that everything they are doing in accordance with the teachings of some gurus is a complete mess. A mess for the creatures that live underneath. In order for the goddess to always protect her husband, women are occasionally asked to leave their bangles in the Ganga. Because it was a part of the offering, that glass bangle kills hundreds of organisms when it breaks. According to the researchers, millions of people engage in a variety of destructive practices, not just hundreds, thousands, or lakhs.
When offered to the temples, offerings such as flowers, sweets, incense sticks, camphor, oil lamps, honey, milk, and much more stay there for a very brief period of time. Following that, they are either thrown in poly bags as usual or disposed of (by very minimum, temples). They would have decomposed, but now that they are wrapped in plastic bags, they will begin to rot and emit an unpleasant stench, which leads to sewage issues.  
Temples still do not properly manage the disposal of all biodegradables; instead, they continue to lie around. People come to worship and take holy dips in the Ganga Ghats. But after washing their clothes, come back. The fact that people come there to get their colours removed after the Holi festival—using soap and other item—is no longer shocking. The Ganges, once divine and costly in its own right, has lost its purity. Up until the 2000s, it was truly a representation of the goddess who lived there, flourishing and vibrant.  
Today's question is: How can we get past these issues that will eventually endanger people's lives? The Flood of 2013 was supposed to demonstrate the true consequences of our actions today in Kedarnath, Rishikesh, and portions of Haridwar. However, despite the fact that COVID-19 demonstrated how eating animals can kill people, people have become harsher towards the environment since then. There have been many examples in the past, but humans never comprehend them.  Ask those who have lost loved ones in these natural disasters. 
The question now is whether religion and sustainability can coexist. Yes, provided that appropriate measures are implemented and faithfully adhered to. Instead, there are a number of activities that can be used to cut down on waste and preserve believers' faith. 
First, we can set up dumping sites in any place of worship, such as temples, Ghats, or public places of devotion. One can simultaneously make an offering to God and help the environment in this way. In order for devotees who bring plastic bags, bottles, and other items to keep them outside and avoid throwing them inside the place of worship, there should be no plastic zones. They can bring metal bottles in place of plastic ones, or there should be filter coolers inside for potable water. 
Since temples are open around-the-clock, installing solar panels would help them use less electricity and encourage environmentally friendly behaviour.
In order to be able to be disposed of later, the puja cloth, which is a sacred offering, should be made from khadi or, if that is too costly, from biodegradable organic matter. Additionally, teaching devotees to care for Mother Earth is just as important as caring for and protecting your own mother. Your Dharma includes both. 
To put it briefly, change begins with the individual. Religion and sustainability not only coexist but flourish when faith is matched with accountability and rituals are carried out mindfully. Real development is about growing in a sustainable way, which is our responsibility.

      "Eco-Anxiety and Emotional Erosion: Where Mental Health Meets Environmental Collapse",
    Article: `The planet isn't the only thing on fire. It's also our peace. Eco Anxiety is when a person is anxious about ongoing threat to our environment. It can be due to a lot of personal feelings towards our mother Earth or sometimes due to just the impacts that are causing you a lot to suffer. Eco-anxiety is a developing psychological reaction to the perceived threat of an environmental catastrophe, but it is not yet a recognised clinical disorder. It is the persistent fear of environmental disaster coupled with feelings of grief, rage, helplessness, and guilt. Eco-anxiety, in contrast to generalised anxiety, stems from a real and ongoing crisis. Environmental deterioration is real and occurring everywhere, from glacier melting to devastating floods. 
Human emotions deteriorate along with the rise in temperatures, the decline of forests, and the extinction of species. Despite being a relatively new term, "eco-anxiety" has a significant impact.
Many people experience eco-anxiety at a young age, particularly children and adolescents. They are constantly exposed to news reports about heat waves, wildfires, plastic-polluted oceans, and the irreversible loss of biodiversity. As they observe those in positions of authority doing little to preserve the planet, they are taught to care for it. Their capacity to feel confident about the future is subtly harmed by the cognitive and emotional dissonance caused by this disconnect.
Climate activists, environmental science students, volunteers, and even casual nature lovers are particularly hard hit by this erosion. These people are always conscious of the suffering on the planet, and although this empathy is admirable, it eventually wears them out emotionally. Every forest that has burned feels intimate. Every oil spill causes heartache.
We are all impacted by climate change, but younger people are disproportionately affected by eco-anxiety. Today's youth are expected to clean up a mess they did not cause, frequently with little authority and in the face of strong corporate and political opposition. They are brought up to be responsible, but they are not given the power to make significant changes. It takes more than just facts and hope to combat eco-anxiety. It needs to be acknowledged. People require safe spaces where they can voice their fears without fear of rejection. Climate education must be combined with emotional resilience in schools. Eco-psychology, the nexus of psychology and ecology, is a necessary field of study for mental health practitioners. Some people find solace in eco-therapy, which includes gardening, forest bathing, spending time in nature with mindfulness, or simply taking a stroll in the sunshine. Climate support groups, where like-minded individuals exchange ideas and solutions, are beneficial to others. Storytelling, poetry, and art have also emerged as potent means of coping with ecological grief.
Crucially, we need to change the way we discuss climate change. We need stories of rebirth, hope, and group strength rather than apocalyptic headlines. While realism is important, it's also important to remember that many communities are growing, changing, and adapting. The tragic accidents in the history have always shown us how people come as depressed from the situation  but the matter has never been brought up in the limelight. 
The climate crisis is a mental health crisis in addition to an environmental one. However, mental health is rarely brought up in conversations about climate policy. This is a risky mistake. People's psychological ecosystems disintegrate along with ecosystems. We must safeguard the earth and those who look after it if we are to create a sustainable future.
Ignoring eco-anxiety is allowing millions of people to bear the burden of the world in silence. However, healing starts when you accept it, encourage it, and deal with it. Even though emotional deterioration happens gradually, it is preventable. We can make sure that having a deep concern for the planet doesn't have to mean going through hardships alone by being brave, compassionate, and connected.
